# Summary of _The Agile Samurai_

*Format: Kindle on the Kindle Touch*

## Why I Read it

I read _[The Agile Samurai](http://pragprog.com/book/jtrap/the-agile-samurai)_ by [Jonathan Rasmusson](https://twitter.com/jrasmusson) because I was undertaking a role as Technical Co-Founder at Violet Grey and I needed to get better at project management and requirement gathering.  The book covers both topics in depth.

## Purpose and Overview

The goal of the book is to teach you how to use the agile mindset to plan and execute on a project.  It has five parts: Introducing Agile, Agile Project Inception, Agile Project Planning, Agile Project Execution, Creating Agile Software.  It builds a case for agile and then explains the step by step process of agile planning.  The book focuses on exercises that can help the steak-holders and developers to make sure they are talking about the same thing.  This synchronization is handled by: the inception deck, frequently releases, and reprioritization after each iteration.

## Format / Style of Writing

The book has a samurai motif.  I know a lot of developers enjoy ninjas and pirates, but I am not one of them.  Each chapter ends with a review in the format of Yoda like conversation between the master sensei and the student.  At first I found these conversations cheesy, but as I read through the book, I found them to be helpful.  They were helpful because the Yoda like repetition of info made you think a little harder and re-enforced the chapter's key principles.

## Other Points

### Planing for Change

I really learned how to handle changing of requirements.  In the past, I wanted to lock requirements down too soon.  This book has taught me to only focus on locking down requirements on a per-iteration bases.  Things will change, so not planning for them to change will result in failure.  Locking features down for an iteration is middle ground between my need to have firm requirements and the customer feeling like they can never change anything.

### Done means done

Along with agility in requirements is the need to release complete software at the end of each sprint.  At the end of each sprint the customer should be able to use the software you finished.  If they can't use it, it is not done.  This need for the software to be done limits how much you are willing to bite off.  It also curbs you from going too far down the wrong path.

## Conclusion

_The Agile Samurai_ is a solid book.  It has a good overview of the agile process and some specific steps to apply the method to your next project.  I found the inception deck helpful.
